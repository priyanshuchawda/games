Abstract
==========
This project is a multi-game entertainment suite developed in Python using Pygame. It features a collection of classic arcade and puzzle games including Pacman, Snake, Pong, Memory Match, Brick Baker, and Flappy Bird. The project implements a unified game launcher with a modern interface and consistent controls across all games.

Introduction
============
The project consists of several key components:

1. Game Launcher System:
- Centralized launcher with an animated interface
- Category-based game organization
- Keyboard and mouse navigation support
- Background music and visual effects
- Fullscreen support

2. Core Game Features:
- Unified base game class (GameBase)
- Consistent pause menu system
- Standardized event handling
- Adaptive screen resolution
- Sound system integration

3. Individual Games Implementation:
- Pacman: Complete with ghost AI and multiple levels
- Snake: Progressive difficulty and score system
- Memory Match: Configurable grid sizes and sound effects
- Brick Baker: Physics-based gameplay
- Pong: AI opponent and score tracking
- Flappy Bird: Classic gameplay mechanics

Conclusions
===========
The project demonstrates several important software engineering principles:

1. Code Reusability:
- Common game base class
- Shared utility functions
- Standardized event handling system

2. Modular Design:
- Separate game implementations
- Structured asset management
- Scene-based game state management

3. User Experience:
- Consistent controls across games
- Unified pause and settings system
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Multi-resolution support

Working Models/Flowcharts
========================
1. Game System Architecture:
   Launcher → Game Selection → Individual Game → Pause System → Game Over → Return to Launcher

2. Core Game Loop:
   Initialize → Handle Events → Update Game State → Draw → Repeat

3. Event Handling Flow:
   Input Detection → State Update → Sound Effects → Visual Updates
